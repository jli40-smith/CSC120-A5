- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affected your programming?
I feel like "Association" made it my code more logical and more representative of objects in the real world. The parts of the Scarecrow could exist separately and have their own methods while also belonging to other classes or objects as parts of them. This helped to organize the program so that the code needed to construct and display each part of the Scarecrow could be kept in separate files and accessed through association. 

I think Association made it easier to implement, test, and debug the printing of each part of the Scarecrow individually, which made the entire coding process easier. Having to code using association also made me think in a more object oriented way, as opposed to a procedural way. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was that I was able to make the Scarecrow print and fulfill the basic performance requirements 
on the different levels of the rubric. What did not work was that I could not think of a way to print just a single right boot without a 
left boot using the current code structure I have, even if I can print each boot individually, if printed first left, then right. I also could not 
think of a way to use some of the template code in Scarecrow.java, such as using myScarecrow.message or a private String message in the code; in the end, I wrote working code which did not involve those snippets, but still satisfy the assignment requirements.
